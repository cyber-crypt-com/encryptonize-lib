The Encryptonize&reg; library provides cryptographic functions for data encryption and decryption, as well as enforcing access control around the encrypted data. It allows developers to easily implement various security schemes and protocols for protecting data.

## Features
- **Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data (AEAD)**
    - binary data can be encrypted/decrypted using the standardized AES256-GCM algorithm
    - the Ciphertext and Associated Data can be securely stored in untrusted locations as the recovery of the plaintext is computationally infeasible without the Encryption Key, and any changes to the Ciphertext or Associated Data will be detected during the decryption process
- **Key Wrapping with Padding Authenticated Encryption (KWP-AE)**
    - each data object is encrypted with a random 256-bit key which is then wrapped with the configured Wrapping Key using the standardized KWP-AE algorithm
    - wrapped keys can be securely stored in untrusted locations as the recovery of the plaintext key is computationally infeasible without the Wrapping Key, and any changes to the Wrapped Key will be detected during the unwrapping process
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**
    - access to encrypted objects can be restricted to specific groups of users with associated role data
- **User Authentication**
    - authentication is done with custom credentials generated by the library functions
- **Searcheable Symmetric Encryption (SSE)**
    - the ability to efficiently search over encrypted objects without decrypting them can be added by creating an index of keywords and adding `(Keyword, ID)` pairs to it
- **Encrypted Security Tokens**
    - security tokens with built-in expiry times and arbitrary encrypted data can be generated and verified
    - can be used for implementing token-based authentication/authorization schemes

## Installation
To use the library in your Go project, you first need to install it by running the following command in the root folder of the project:
```
go get -u github.com/cyber-crypt-com/encryptonize-lib@latest
```

Then, you can access the Encryptonize&reg; library functions by importing the library in our application code:
```
import github.com/cyber-crypt-com/encryptonize-lib
```
